Data analysis using python:Exploratory Analysis to Find Trends in Movie Data  
Member: Feifan Xu, Kai Wang, Sina Malekian  
We plan to investigate a movies dataset to find trends in the data. The analysis can help a film production company like Warner Bros., Fox Star Studios, etc. to decide which movie titles can mean profits if funded for production, how much to bid on produced movies, when to release, how much to invest in marketing and PR, etc. This information will not only help the studio before a title is released, but also helpful after the release. An example for this could be - the analysis can help with insights on how much a studio should negotiate with on-demand streaming companies for a second window streaming rights, etc. That said, it is not a prediction problem - it involves studying the analysis and understanding the conclusions.
